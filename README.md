# Tuition Management Reimbursement System

## Project Description
The purpose of TRMS is to provide a system that encourages quality knowledge growth relevant to an individualâ€™s expertise.   Currently, TRMS provides reimbursements
for university courses, seminars, certification preparation classes, certifications, and technical training.  The decision has been made to develop a BPM solution for
this system to improve the timeliness and accuracy of approvals.  The current system relies solely on email communication, requiring manual lookups of available funds
and is error-prone due to inbox clutter and incorrect routing of tasks.  Furthermore, there is no way to record and report on reimbursements awarded, and so the
company has no way to identify highly-invested courses that could be developed to be offered in-house.
